/*
Brent Ozar Unlimited(TM)'s Temp Stored Procs for SQL Server 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you're only allowed to create stored procedures in TempDB, execute this
file and you'll get most of our utility stored procedures. Keep in mind, of
course, that they won't be present on system restart.

The following stored procs aren't available for SQL 2005:
* sp_BlitzCache
* sp_BlitzRS
* sp_BlitzTrace

sp_AskBrent (TM)

(C) 2015, Brent Ozar Unlimited. 
See http://BrentOzar.com/go/eula for the End User Licensing Agreement.

Sure, the server needs tuning - but why is it slow RIGHT NOW?
sp_AskBrent performs quick checks for things like:

* Blocking queries that have been running a long time
* Backups, restores, DBCCs
* Recently cleared plan cache
* Transactions that are rolling back

To learn more, visit http://www.BrentOzar.com/askbrent/ where you can download
new versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
the findings, and more.  To contribute code and see your name in the change
log, email your improvements & checks to Help@BrentOzar.com.

Known limitations of this version:
 - No support for SQL Server 2000 or compatibility mode 80.
 - If a temp table called #CustomPerfmonCounters exists for any other session,
   but not our session, this stored proc will fail with an error saying the
   temp table #CustomPerfmonCounters doesn't exist.

Unknown limitations of this version:
 - None. Like Zombo.com, the only limit is yourself.

Changes in v13 - Feb 22, 2015
 - Added Server Info output of priority 251 for Total Database Size and Total
   Databases (checks 21 and 22).
 - Added parameters @OutputTableNameFileStats, @OutputTableNamePerfmon, and
   @OutputTableNameWaitStats to persist these work tables to disk if you want
   to examine performance over time. I'd strongly recommend that you buy a
   real monitoring program, though. I'm only storing the second pass of each
   statistic, not the differentials. This is useful for doing your own deltas
   between passes of sp_AskBrent, like running sp_AskBrent every 5 minutes via
   a SQL Server Agent job. You can use any of the @OutputTableName params
   individually, or as a group - it's up to you which data you want to keep.
 - Bug fixes and improvements.

Changes in v12 - Feb 16, 2015
 - Added Server Info output of priority 250 for Batch Requests per Second and
   Wait Time per Core per Second (checks 19 and 20).

Changes in v11 - Nov 20, 2014
 - Jefferson Elias of Belgium added more Perfmon counters to ExpertMode output.
 - Added @FileLatencyThresholdMS to let you set the default read/write warning
   trigger in milliseconds. It's always been 100ms, so that's the default.
 - Added @SkipChecksQueries, defaults to on. Most folks seem to get confused by
   the detailed output of which queries ran the most often during the sample,
   so we're skipping that by default now - which also makes it go faster, too.
 - Bug fixes and improvements.

Changes in v10 - May 22, 2014
 - Added some new SQL 2014 harmless wait stats like 
   QDS_CLEANUP_STALE_QUERIES_TASK_MAIN_LOOP_SLEEP.
 - Added ExpertMode columns for more plan cache metrics analysis on the query's
   percentage of the server's load during the sample, plus overall load.
 - Added @OutputType = 'Opserver1' to output results in a format that works
   better for Opserver, the open source monitoring tool of champions. Get it:
   https://github.com/opserver/Opserver
 - Added thresholds to Most Resource-Intensive Queries. Now requires 1000 page
   reads, 1 second of CPU time, or 1 second of duration before queries are
   shown. This prevents the "idle presenter laptop" problem where IntelliSense
   queries show up as resource-intensive.
 - Added DatabaseID, DatabaseName for query plans when ExpertMode = 1.
 - Added @FilterPlansByDatabase. Takes a comma-delimited list of database IDs
   and only looks for resource-intensive plans in those databases. Also takes
   the parameter 'USER' for only user databases.
 - Creation script now defaults to ALTER PROCEDURE instead of CREATE.
 - Raised compilations/sec and recompilations/sec thresholds to 100/sec.

Changes in v9 - Nov 3, 2013
 - Changed date format to accommodate the British. They gave us Gordon Ramsay,
   so it's the least I could do. Many folks reported this one.

Changes in v8 - October 21, 2013
 - Whoops! Left an extra line in check 8 that failed on SQL 2005.

Changes in v7 - October 21, 2013
 - Updated many of the links to point to newly published pages.
 - Performance tuning Check 8 (sleeping connections with open transactions).
   Went from >1 minute at StackExchange to <10 seconds.

Changes in v6 - October 11, 2013
 - Time travel enabled. Can log to database using the @Output* parameters, and
   you can go back in time with the @AsOf parameter.
 - Bug fixing for SQL Server 2005 compatibility.

Changes in v5 - September 16, 2013
 - Enabled @Question again.
 - Bail out of plan cache analysis if we're more than 10 seconds behind.

Changes in v4 - August 25, 2013
 - Added plan cache analysis.
 - Fixed checkid 8 (sleeping query with open transactions) for SQL 2005/08/R2.
 - Refactored a little for readability.
 - Added QueryPlan to the default results because the plan cache stuff is cool.

Changes in v3 - August 23, 2013
 - Added @OutputType = 'SCHEMA', which returns the version number and a list
   of columns for a CREATE TABLE definition for the default outputs. We don't
   include the actual CREATE TABLE part because you might want to use a table
   variable or whatever.
 - Added @OutputXMLasNVARCHAR. If 1, then the QueryPlan is outputted as an
   NVARCHAR(MAX) instead of XML. This helps if you want to insert the
   sp_AskBrent results into a temp table. For instructions, visit:

Changes in v2 - August 9, 2013
 - Added @Seconds to control the sampling time.
 - @ExpertMode now returns all work tables with no thresholds.
 - Added basic wait stats, file stats, Perfmon checks.

Changes in v1 - July 11, 2013
 - Initial bug-filled release. We purposely left extra errors on here so
   you could email bug reports to Help@BrentOzar.com, thereby increasing
   your self-esteem. It's all about you.

	Known limitations of this version:
	 - No support for SQL Server 2000 or compatibility mode 80.
	 - If a database name has a question mark in it, some tests will fail. Gotta
	   love that unsupported sp_MSforeachdb.
	 - If you have offline databases, sp_Blitz fails the first time you run it,
	   but does work the second time. (Hoo, boy, this will be fun to debug.)

	Unknown limitations of this version:
	 - None.  (If we knew them, they would be known. Duh.)

   	Changes in v41 - June 18, 2015
     - Added check 162 for CMEMTHREAD waits on servers with >= 8 logical
	   processors per NUMA node.
	 - Added check 159 for NUMA nodes reporting dangerously low memory in
	   sys.dm_os_nodes.
	 - Added check 161 for a high number of cached plans per KB 3026083.
     - Fixed a bug in the SkipChecks routines. Reported by Kevin Collins.
     - Backup-to-same-drive-as-databases check (93) now includes the number of
	   backups that were done so you can tell if it was a one-off problem, or if
	   all backups are going to the wrong place.
     - Bug fixes and improvements.

  	Changes in v40 - April 27, 2015
	 - Added check 158 for 1MB growth sizes on databases over 10GB. Probably time
       to up that growth size. Contributed by Henrik Staun Poulsen.
     - Added check 159 for queries with more than 50 execution plans in cache,
       an indicator that it is not parameterized properly.
     - Fixed check 97 that said Data Center Edition was subject to CPU and
       memory limits, which is not true. It is only subject to wallet limits.
       Reported by Brad Nelson.
     - Fixed checks 106, 150, 151 to be skipped when the default trace file has
       disappeared. Coded by Steve Coles.
     - Fixed check 1, the VERY FIRST CHECK IN THE SCRIPT, which had a bug when
       catching databases that had never been backed up. Sure, there was a
       workaround in the next statement, but Julie Citro spotted the bug and
       made it right. First check, people. All of you who ever read this code,
       Julie Citro is officially a better code reviewer than you.
  	 - Skip backup checks on offline databases.
  	 - For order and join hints, raised threshold to 1000 instead of 1.
	 
  	Changes in v39 - February 16, 2015
	 - Added @OutputType option for NONE if you only want to log the results to
	    a table. (For Jefferson Elias.)
  	 - Bug fixes and improvements. (Thanks, Nathan Sunderman.)

 	Changes in v38 - November 20, 2014
 	 - Added check 157 for dangerous builds of SQL Server that are affected by
 	   MS Security Bulletin MS14-044.
	 - Added current date to output as check 156, priority 254. Requested by
	   Denise Crabtree, who runs sp_Blitz on a regular basis and saves the
	   results in a spreadsheet. Yay, Denise!
	 - Bug fixes and improvements to wait stats checks.

 	Changes in v37 - November 19, 2014
	 - Added wait stats checks when @CheckServerInfo = 1. Check 152 looks for
	   waits that have accounted for more than 10% of minimum possible wait
	   time. If your 4-core server has been up for 40 hours, that is 160 hours
	   of potential wait time (and of course it could be much higher when
	   multiple queries are stacked up on each core.) In that case, we only
	   alert on waits that have accounted for at least 16 hours of wait time.
	   We are trying to avoid false-alarming when servers are sitting idle.
	 - Added check 154 for 32-bit SQL Servers.
	 - Added check 155 for sp_Blitz versions more than 6 months old.

	For prior changes, see: http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitz/changelog/


	Parameter explanations:

	@CheckUserDatabaseObjects	1=review user databases for triggers, heaps, etc. Takes more time for more databases and objects.
	@CheckServerInfo			1=show server info like CPUs, memory, virtualization
	@CheckProcedureCache		1=top 20-50 resource-intensive cache plans and analyze them for common performance issues.
	@OutputProcedureCache		1=output the top 20-50 resource-intensive plans even if they did not trigger an alarm
	@CheckProcedureCacheFilter	''CPU'' | ''Reads'' | ''Duration'' | ''ExecCount''
	@OutputType					''TABLE''=table | ''COUNT''=row with number found | ''SCHEMA''=version and field list | ''NONE'' = none
	@IgnorePrioritiesBelow		100=ignore priorities below 100
	@IgnorePrioritiesAbove		100=ignore priorities above 100
	For the rest of the parameters, see http://www.brentozar.com/blitz/documentation for details.

(C) 2014, Brent Ozar Unlimited(TM). 
See http://BrentOzar.com/go/eula for the End User Licensing Agreement.

For help and how-to info, visit http://www.BrentOzar.com/BlitzIndex

How to use:
--	Diagnose:
		EXEC dbo.sp_BlitzIndex @DatabaseName='AdventureWorks';
--	Return detail for a specific table:
		EXEC dbo.sp_BlitzIndex @DatabaseName='AdventureWorks', @SchemaName='Person', @TableName='Person';

Known limitations of this version:
 - Does not include FULLTEXT indexes. (A possibility in the future, let us know if you're interested.)
 - Index create statements are just to give you a rough idea of the syntax. It includes filters and fillfactor.
 --		Example 1: index creates use ONLINE=? instead of ONLINE=ON / ONLINE=OFF. This is because it's important for the user to understand if it's going to be offline and not just run a script.
 --		Example 2: they do not include all the options the index may have been created with (padding, compression filegroup/partition scheme etc.)
 --		(The compression and filegroup index create syntax isn't trivial because it's set at the partition level and isn't trivial to code. Two people have voted for wanting it so far.)
 - Doesn't advise you about data modeling for clustered indexes and primary keys (primarily looks for signs of insanity.)
 - Found something? Let us know at help@brentozar.com.

 Thanks for using sp_BlitzIndex(TM)!

CHANGE LOG (last five versions):
	Jan 30, 2014 (v2.02)
		Standardized calling parameters with sp_AskBrent(TM) and sp_BlitzIndex(TM). (@DatabaseName instead of @database_name, etc)
		Added check_id 80 and 81-- what appear to be the most frequently used indexes (workaholics)
		Added index_operational_stats info to table level output -- recent scans vs lookups
		Broke index_usage_stats output into two categories, scans and lookups (also in table level output)
		Changed db name, table name, index name to 128 length
		Fixed findings_group column length in #BlitzIndexResults (fixed issues for users w/ longer db names)
		Fixed issue where identities nearing end of range were only detected if the check was run with a specific db context
			Fixed extra tab in @SchemaName= that made pasting into Excel awkward/wrong
		Added abnormal psychology check for clustered columnstore indexes (and general support for detecting them)
		Standardized underscores in create TSQL for missing indexes
		Better error message when running in table mode and the table isn't found.
		Added current timestamp to the header based on user request. (Didn't add startup time-- sorry! Too many things reset usage info, don't want to mislead anyone.)
		Added fillfactor to index create statements.
		Changed all index create statements to ONLINE=?, SORT_IN_TEMPDB=?. The user should decide at index create time what's right for them.
	May 26, 2013 (v2.01)
		Added check_id 28: Non-unqiue clustered indexes. (This should have been checked in for an earlier version, it slipped by).
	May 14, 2013 (v2.0) - Added data types and max length to all columns (keys, includes, secret columns)
		Set sp_blitz to default to current DB if database_name is not specified when called
		Added @Filter:  
			0=no filter (default)
			1=Don't throw low-usage warnings for objects with 0 reads (helpful for dev/non-production environments)
			2=Only report on objects >= 250MB (helps focus on larger indexes). Still runs a few database-wide checks as well.
		Added list of all columns and types in table for runs using: @DatabaseName, @SchemaName, @TableName
		Added count of total number of indexes a column is part of.
		Added check_id 25: Addicted to nullable columns. (All or all but one column is nullable.)
		Added check_id 66 and 67 to flag tables/indexes created within 1 week or modified within 48 hours.
		Added check_id 26: Wide tables (35+ cols or > 2000 non-LOB bytes).
		Added check_id 27: Addicted to strings. Looks for tables with 4 or more columns, of which all or all but one are string or LOB types.
		Added check_id 68: Identity columns within 30% of the end of range (tinyint, smallint, int) AND
			Negative identity seeds or identity increments <> 1
		Added check_id 69: Column collation does not match database collation
		Added check_id 70: Replicated columns. This identifies which columns are in at least one replication publication.
		Added check_id 71: Cascading updates or cascading deletes.
		Split check_id 40 into two checks: fillfactor on nonclustered indexes < 80%, fillfactor on clustered indexes < 90%
		Added check_id 33: Potential filtered indexes based on column names.
		Fixed bug where you couldn't see detailed view for indexed views. 
			(Ex: EXEC dbo.sp_BlitzIndex @DatabaseName='AdventureWorks', @SchemaName='Production', @TableName='vProductAndDescription';)
		Added four index usage columns to table detail output: last_user_seek, last_user_scan, last_user_lookup, last_user_update
		Modified check_id 24. This now looks for wide clustered indexes (> 3 columns OR > 16 bytes).
			Previously just simplistically looked for multiple column CX.
		Removed extra spacing (non-breaking) in more_info column.
		Fixed bug where create t-sql didn't include filter (for filtered indexes)
		Fixed formatting bug where "magic number" in table detail view didn't have commas
		Neatened up column names in result sets.
	April 8, 2013 (v1.5) - Fixed breaking bug for partitioned tables with > 10(ish) partitions
		Added schema_name to suggested create statement for PKs
		Handled "magic_benefit_number" values for missing indexes >= 922,337,203,685,477
		Added count of NC indexes to Index Hoarder: Multi-column clustered index finding
		Added link to EULA
		Simplified aggressive index checks (blocking). Multiple checks confused people more than it helped.
			Left only "Total lock wait time > 5 minutes (row + page)".
		Added CheckId 25 for non-unique clustered indexes. 
		The "Create TSQL" column now shows a commented out drop command for disabled non-clustered indexes
		Updated query which joins to sys.dm_operational_stats DMV when running against 2012 for performance reasons
	December 20, 2012 (v1.4) - Fixed bugs for instances using a case-sensitive collation
		Added support to identify compressed indexes
		Added basic support for columnstore, XML, and spatial indexes
		Added "Abnormal Psychology" diagnosis to alert you to special index types in a database
		Removed hypothetical indexes and disabled indexes from "multiple personality disorders"
		Fixed bug where hypothetical indexes weren't showing up in "self-loathing indexes"
		Fixed bug where the partitioning key column was displayed in the key of aligned nonclustered indexes on partitioned tables
		Added set options to the script so procedure is created with required settings for its use of computed columns
